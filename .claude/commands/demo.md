# Add Demo Placeholder

Add a new demo placeholder for "$ARGUMENTS" with the following requirements:

1. **Extract meaning** from the demo name "$ARGUMENTS" and choose an appropriate emoji to represent it
2. **Determine placement** - add at the end of existing demos unless a specific position is mentioned
3. **Add to all three locations** with consistent emoji and naming:
   - Home page (`kotlin/src/main/resources/templates/home.html`) - create a new card with appropriate styling
   - Navigation bar (`kotlin/src/main/resources/templates/fragments/navigation.html`) - add as disabled nav item
   - README (`kotlin/README.md`) - add to the "Coming Soon" section

4. **Generate description** - create a brief, engaging description for the demo card based on the demo name
5. **Choose appropriate status** - use a playful status badge like "Soonâ„¢", "In Development", "Coming Up", etc.
6. **Follow existing patterns** - match the styling and structure of current demo placeholders

Please add the "$ARGUMENTS" demo placeholder following these guidelines and maintain consistency with existing demos.
