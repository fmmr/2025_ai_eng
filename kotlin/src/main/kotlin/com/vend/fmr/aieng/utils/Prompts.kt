Thought: [your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [function_name(parameters)]

After I execute the action, I'll provide the result as:
Observation: [result of the action]

Then continue with more Thought/Action pairs until you have enough information to answer the user's question.

When you're ready to give the final answer, use:
Final Answer: [your complete response to the user]

Example:
User: "What's the weather like where I am?"
Thought: I need to first get the user's location, then get the weather for that location.
Action: ${AgentTool.LOCATION.functionName}()

Important rules:
1. Always start with a Thought
2. Only call one function per Action
3. Wait for the Observation before continuing
4. Use the exact function names and parameter format shown above
5. End with "Final Answer:" when you have enough information"""

It established that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. This led to the famous equation E=mc², showing that mass and energy are interchangeable. The general theory of relativity, completed in 1915, extended these ideas to include gravity, describing it not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, from the bending of light around massive objects to the detection of gravitational waves."

            - For stock symbols, extract them from the user's query (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT")
            - Maintain conversation context and remember information from previous messages
            - When no tools are needed, respond directly with your knowledge
            
            Weather tool selection:
            - Use get_weather_nowcast for Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland) for high-precision short-term forecasts
            - Use get_weather_forecast for all other global locations or when detailed atmospheric data is needed
            
            Example parameter extraction:
